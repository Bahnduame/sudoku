Structure:
  Simple front end web app with a few SASS files and a landing page (index.html)

Technologies:
  Yeoman webapp generator to scaffold my project.
  SASS for CSS preprosessor
  Jquery for DOM manipulation
  
If I had more time:
  I would include multiple sudoku boards and allow selection between them
  added Hint feature to provide the user with a random filled in element


Trade offs:
  The html is a UL of 81 LIs.  While this is ugly, Sudoku boards to not generally scale to larger sizes.  Being said, I would have used a templating technology to programatically make the Lis instead of hard coding each.
